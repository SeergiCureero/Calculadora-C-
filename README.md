# Calculadora C++
 In this project I've tried to make a simple calculator using c++
 I'm learning C++ at school but with the teacher that I have is nearly impossible to learn something. This is my first off-school project in c++. 
 
 Function names are written in catalan and all of them take and return floats
 
 Suma() = Addition
 
 Resta() = Substraction
 
 Multiplicacio() = Multiplication
 
 Divisio() = Division
 
 Quadrat() = Square
 
 Cub() = Cube
 
 Exponent() = Exponent
 
 
 TODO:
 -Allow functions to take unlimited arguments and operate with them: Suma(2,3,5) => 10
 -Write more functions such as Sin, Cos, Tan...
