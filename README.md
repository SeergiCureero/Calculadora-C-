# Calculadora C++
 In this project I've tried to make a simple calculator using c++
 
 I'm learning C++ at school but at a very slow pace, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and start to write some code and explore by myself. This is my first off-school project in c++. 
 
 
 Function names are written in catalan and all of them take and return floats
 
 -Suma() = Addition
 
 -Resta() = Substraction
 
-Multiplicacio() = Multiplication
 
 -Divisio() = Division
 
 -Quadrat() = Square
 
 -Cub() = Cube
 
 -Exponent() = Exponent
 
 
 
 TODO:
 
 -Allow functions to take unlimited arguments and operate with them: Suma(2,3,5) => 10
 
 -Write more functions such as Sin, Cos, Tan...
